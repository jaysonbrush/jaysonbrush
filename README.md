## Hi, I'm Jayson

**Director of Research and Innovation at [Menlo](https://menloinc.com)**

I've spent 15+ years building platform infrastructure that hundreds of thousands of users depend on daily. Developing systems that can't go down, making the architecture decisions that compound over years, and laying the foundational work that makes scaling possible.

I focus on what lasts. Things that are simple enough to maintain, secure enough to trust, and efficient enough to grow with.
